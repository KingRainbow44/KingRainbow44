My name is Magix but everyone knows me by my alias Kingrainbow44, I love software development and Genshin Impact, but only because im forced to.
I have a friend named BlueJay who has a stranglehold on everything I do, for some reason I keep making bets with her in hopes of someday winning, It's like a strange addiction I can't shake.
